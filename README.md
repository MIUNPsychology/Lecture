# Lecture

The "Lecture" Unity project is an attempt at building a VR based experiment on reactions to facial expressions and number of persons present in a room. 

The experiment will gradually expose the testee to more crowded and hostile scenes. 

## Installation and requirements

This is a Unity project. You will need https://unity3d.com/ to run it. 

While it is possible to run the experiment on a normal monitor, it will be somewhat pointless to do so. The project is targeted at Oculus Rift Cv1. 

But once unity and oculus is available and properly set up, all you need to do is to open the project in unity and press the play button.
